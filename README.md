# hodlwin-token
HODLwin "WIN" is an ERC-20 token, supported by an independent token buyer contract 
HODLwin2Eth contract is a decentralised trustless HODLwin/Ether exchange contract on the Ethereum blockchain.

Launched on main net in tandem, although WIN tokens will be available on exchanges the exchagnes will not be required to trade HODLwin tokens for Ethereum. The HODLwin2Eth exchanger can receive ether from any source but will only release it in exchange for HODLwin tokens. Once it receveives HODLwin tokens they are trapped permanently in the contract effectively burning them.
Effectively as long as HODLwin has a revenue stream feeding directly into the HODLwin2Eth contract token holders will always be able to exchange their tokens for eth without reliance on exchanges. The price can also never be lowered below the launched price only raised.
